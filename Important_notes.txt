-Less is more. Anyone can make it hard, but only the expert can make things simple. 
Implement simple models. 

Models to implement
1 Pure neural network

https://github.com/adeshpande3/March-Madness-2017/blob/master/Applying%20Deep%20Learning.ipynb
https://github.com/wdg3/march-madness/blob/master/source/madness.py
https://www.kaggle.com/boyadzhi/cross-validation-on-any-year
https://www.kaggle.com/aikinogard/cf-starter-with-keras-0-560136 (different features, softmax)
2 Ranking system ensemble 
https://www.kaggle.com/jdp6ax/bayesian-ncaam-predictions
https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-our-march-madness-predictions-work/ (use five thirty eight to predict the rating)
3 Rating system feature 
https://www.kaggle.com/lpkirwin/fivethirtyeight-elo-ratings
4 Features (10+)
https://www.kaggle.com/lnatml/feature-engineering-with-advanced-stats egular season wins,fg , rebounding, and points, and turnovers/steal
https://github.com/adeshpande3/March-Madness-2017/blob/master/ last 10 game streak. 
5 Specific features (Google Features) 
-win lose ratio
-point differnetial
-strength of opponents
-seed matters (difference in seed numbers and percentage of win)
-recent performance last 10 games. 
-efg, 3pt percentage, assists to turnovers, rebounding marging, effective shooting percentage. 
-variance, 3 pointers and variances
6 The Pomeroy model. 
https://github.com/sfirke/predicting-march-madness/blob/master/scripts/05_make_predictions.R
7 Ensemble/Evaluate

Notes
-No team fallen 1 - 16
-2018_data file submission

Data
-Ken Pomeroy model used by everyone

Features
-Offensive rebound important. 
-Can do pretty well by just using ELO + 16 original features. presented by team. 
-Rating system in massey ordinals Rating system in Massey Ordinals
-Elo rating system https://www.kaggle.com/lpkirwin/fivethirtyeight-elo-ratings


Models. 
-Logistic regression 
-Neural network https://www.kaggle.com/amitkumarjaiswal/basic-starter-kernel-ncaa-men-s-dataset
-Support vector machines
-Random forests
-Gradient tree boosted classifier
-Train with 5 fold cross validation. 
-Used f1 score balance of precision recall 
Pseudocode for testing model
# Build the working data.
X, y = build_season_data(all_data)
model = linear_model.LogisticRegression()
cross_validation.cross_val_score(model, numpy.array(X), numpy.array(y), cv=10, scoring='accuracy', n_jobs=-1).mean(). can use f1. 
model.fit(X, y)
