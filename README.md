## March Madness Prediction Challenge - Kaggle
https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge

## Overview and Work Pipeline
- Preprocessing
- Feature Extraction
- Model Selection
- Ensemble
- Repeat and Win

## Structure of Repo
code - contains all the preprocessing, features, models, and ensembles we have done. Only commit and push to the masters code if your model will be good for ensembling. All other models and code should be left in your branch

input - has all the inputs

notes - useful and unuseful notes about the contest, also has images and graphs that might help for feature extraction

submissions - output files go here

## Work Flow 
Please update this README.md file continually so we know what models have already been tested. That way we won't repeat ourselves. Post the link and general description of the model you have tested below (accuracy, results, findings, and anything you think would be useful)

Model 1: Sample Submission (Chuck)
